### Background and Stories

The program is a window through which people from parallel worlds transmit information to the viewer. Each window has its own password, which is verified correctly before the viewer can peek into the story within. The work invites the viewer to participate in the advancement of the story through an interactive mode. The story follows the protagonist as events escalate, from the awakening of self-consciousness, to the multiple choices he makes, and finally... 

As the viewer reads the story they are presented with different options, selecting different buttons that will take them to a '404' error page or to continue the story. Pressing the 'wrong button' forces the viewer to exit the page in progress, jump back to the password re-entry screen or annoy the user, or wear down the user's patience so that they choose to skip the story or leave; or re-enter the story and accept the rules of the other world when choosing again, choosing 'yes possible correct answer". No one knows what the outcome will be until the button is pressed. 
  
The artist observes the user's reactions to the different options selected during the user testing process and interviews the user after the experience to see if the app conveys the emotional feelings I expected, with the aim of other-worldly expression and narration.  This is an experiment in narrative work, iterating through the user experience for sustainable design.

The program attempts to spread fear and raise questions in the viewer's experience ---- How do negatives stay awake in an absolute value factory? Or, ignorance is bless.
   
   
   
   
程序是平行世界的人们向观众传递信息的窗口。每个窗口都有自己的密码，密码验证正确后，观者才能窥探其中的故事，作品通过互动模式邀请观众参与故事的推进。故事讲述了在事件逐步升级的情况下，主人公从自我意识觉醒，做出多次选择，最后... 

观者在阅读故事时会碰见不同的选项，选择不同按钮后，会进入“404”错误页面，或继续故事。按下“错误的按钮”后，被迫退出进行中的页面、跳回到重新输入密码界面或另使用者烦躁，或消磨使用者的耐心使其选择跳过故事或选择离去；或是重新进入故事后，在再次选择时接受另一世界的规则，选择“有可能的正确答案”。 在按钮被按下前谁也不知道会是什么结果。 
  
艺术家在用户测试流程中观察用户选到不同选项的反应，在用户结束体验后对其进行使用感受采访，观察app是否传达给用户我所预期的情绪感受，从而达到另一世界人们进行表达和讲述的目的。  这是篇叙述性的作品实验，通过用户体验进行迭代，进行可持续的设计。

程序试图在观者的体验中传播恐惧并提出疑问————在绝对值工厂里，负数们该如何保持清醒？或者说，无知是福吗？
