### Background and Stories

The program is a window through which people from parallel worlds transmit information to the viewer. Each window has a unique password that must be entered correctly in order for the viewer to watch the tale within. Through an interactive mode, the work enables the audience to take part in the development of the narrative. The protagonist is followed as the plot progresses, from his growing self-awareness through the many decisions he takes, and eventually...

The reader is given a variety of alternatives as they read the narrative, and they may choose from buttons that will either send them to a "404" error page or allow them to continue reading. When a user presses the "wrong button," they are forced to quit the "404" page, return to the password entry screen, become irritated or lose patience, leading them to decide to skip the story or quit; alternatively, they can re-enter the story by enter the password again, and accept the rules of the alternate reality by selecting possible "correct answer" this time. No one knows what the outcome will be until the button is pressed. 

Or, ignorance is bless.   
   
程序是平行世界的人们向观众传递信息的窗口。每个窗口都有自己的密码，密码验证正确后，观者才能窥探其中的故事，作品通过互动模式邀请观众参与故事的推进。故事讲述了在事件逐步升级的情况下，主人公从自我意识觉醒，做出多次选择，最后... 

观者在阅读故事时会碰见不同的选项，选择不同按钮后，会进入“404”错误页面，或继续故事。按下“错误的按钮”后，被迫退出进行中的页面、跳回到重新输入密码界面或另使用者烦躁，或消磨使用者的耐心使其选择跳过故事或选择离去；或是重新进入故事后，在再次选择时接受另一世界的规则，选择“有可能的正确答案”。 在按钮被按下前谁也不知道会是什么结果。 
  
艺术家在用户测试流程中观察用户选到不同选项的反应，在用户结束体验后对其进行使用感受采访，观察app是否传达给用户我所预期的情绪感受，从而达到另一世界人们进行表达和讲述的目的。  这是篇叙述性的作品实验，通过用户体验进行迭代，进行可持续的设计。

程序试图在观者的体验中传播恐惧并提出疑问————在绝对值工厂里，负数们该如何保持清醒？或者说，无知是福吗？ 


   
  

### Devices And Applications

Hardware： Laptop, iphone  

Software:  Xcode, colab  

### Production process

#### (1)  Research

Research games, the ways of music interaction, visual design, and style

#### (2)  Brain storming

Designed story Line, UX, discuss about the game theme.

#### (3)  Research and try different interaction hardware and build Interactive framework

Try different clips and hardwares, like Leapmition, kinect, piazo, midi board, slider and so on

#### (4)  Build the 3D model and landscape (Blender, UE5)

We tried to use blender to build the landscape by Grayscale in Blender, but it looks better just capture it in Unreal

#### (5)  Put models into the world (UE5)

#### (6)  Design the UI (Blender)

We didn't got time to put all of them into the game yet, but we will make it later on

#### (7)  Make music and record city sound samples(Logic, midi board and voice memos)

#### (8)  Draw materials for city models(Substance Painter)

We run into errors after designing 3D-to-2D styles in Blender, we can't import them into Unreal, so we used the SP to paint the materials.

#### (9)  Link the materials to 3D models(UE5)

#### (10) Make visual and music interaction function (UE5)

#### (11) Link virtual world interaction with Kinect(Azure Kinect Body Tracking SDK 1.1.2)

#### (12) Design and 3D print controller (Blender, Ultimaker-Cura)

We hand-made the controller first, then designed it in Blender and printed it out. Tested, designed again, then print out the third one.

#### (13) Sewing clips and put into the controller(Arduino, hand making material)

#### (14) Iteration Design

For UX, UI, Controller version1 to 3

#### (15)Preapring materials for exhibition

#### (16)Test, interview and make iteration design

#### (17)Meeting for further developing

### Details of Blueprints in UE5

#### (1)Landscape

We use four layers of landscape


#### (2)Materials

First are the 3 Landscape materials:



Flashing Ball:



#### (3)Niagara System (Effects）

All the effects in our game are fitted with Audios, by using Audio Spectrum and fed it with the particles' Normalized age, which is from 0-1, and put in spectrum then the particle can get some delta value.


#### (4)Shading(Rendering Pipeline)

We use the PostProcess Volume way to adjust the style of our game, and the pipeline script is here:

Overall:
